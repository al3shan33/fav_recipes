        <h1>Banana Bread Tips</h1>
        <h2>How do I quickly ripen bananas?</h2>
        <p>When baking with bananas, use ones that are ripe (or even overripe) to yield the best flavor. If you have a day or two to spare, place bananas and an apple, avocado, peach or tomato in a brown paper bag and keep on your counter. This will trap the ethylene gas of the fruits and quicken the ripening process. To ripen bananas even faster, place them in their peels on a baking sheet and warm in a 250° oven for 15-20 minutes. Check out this article for more banana ripening tips.</p>

        <h2>Do you have to use baking soda in banana bread?</h2>
        <p>Both baking soda and baking powder are chemical leaveners that provide lift to your baked goods. If you want some rise in your banana bread and don’t have baking soda handy, try substituting baking powder. Baking powder is about 4 times weaker than baking soda. So for this recipe, use 4 teaspoons baking powder as a substitute for the 1 teaspoon baking soda. If the rise is not important to you, you can leave it out completely. Learn more on the differences between baking soda and baking powder.

        <h2>How do you keep banana bread moist after baking?</h2>
        <p>To keep banana bread moist, let it cool completely on a cooling rack. If you plan on eating the banana bread within 2-4 days, store on the counter in an airtight container lined with paper towels. For longer storage, freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Learn more on storing your favorite baked goods.</p>
