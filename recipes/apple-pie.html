            <li>Preheat oven to 375°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling; dot with butter.</li>
            <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon. Cover edge loosely with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>

        <h1>Apple Pie Tips</h1>
        <h2>What are the best apples to use in pies?</h2>
        <p>In the Taste of Home Test Kitchen, we prefer using Granny Smith apples for pies because of their tart flavor and ability to hold their shape. If you want something with a little more sweetness, we recommend using Braeburn, Golden Delicious or Jonagold. Learn more about the best apples for apple pie and pick your favorite.</p>
        <h2>How many apples are in 6 cups?</h2>
        <p>Typically, 1 medium apple yields 1-1/3 cups sliced. For 6 cups of sliced apples, you will need about 5 medium apples. Plus, you'll have a little left over for a snack or to use in any of these apple recipes.</p>
        <h2>How do you keep the bottom of an apple pie from getting soggy?</h2>
        <p>To avoid a pie bottom that's soggy, allow the bottom crust to heat more rapidly than the rest of the pie. To do this, place a baking sheet in the oven while preheating and then bake your pie on the sheet.</p>
        <h2>Is it better to bake a pie in glass or metal?</h2>
        <p>Both metal and glass pie plates work well for baking double-crust pies. But for single-crust pies that are pre-baked, a metal plate is preferred because it heats quicker and ensures a crisp crust. Find more pie baking tips in our ultimate pie baking guide.</p>
        <h2>How do I keep my pie filling from being watery?</h2>
        <p>To prevent your pie from getting watery, make sure to have your pie crust ready before mixing the filling. The longer the filling sits before baking, the more moisture it will release. Follow these best-kept pie crust secrets so your crust can hold your pie filling nice and strong!</p>
        <h2>How should you store a baked apple pie?</h2>
        <p>Once your pie is fully cooled, you can store it at room temperature in a pie dome, cake carrier, or in an airtight container for up to two days. After two days, it can go in the refrigerator and will last for an additional two more days. Learn more about refrigerating apple pie and how to properly store the fall dessert.</p>
        <h2>Can you freeze apple pie?</h2>
        <p>If you're going to freeze your apple pie, it's best to freeze it before baking—but you can freeze it after baking as well. Place either baked or unbaked pie uncovered in the freezer. Once it's frozen solid, wrap the pie or store it in an airtight container and place it back into the freezer. Then, you can keep it frozen for 3 to 4 months. If unbaked, let the pie fully thaw before baking.</p>
        <h2>Dough for double-crust pie</h2>
        <p>Combine 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 tsp. salt; cut in 1 cup cold butter until crumbly. Gradually add 1/3 to 2/3 cup ice water, tossing with a fork until dough holds together when pressed. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.</p>
